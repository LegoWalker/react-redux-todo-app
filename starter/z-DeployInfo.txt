1) Install the gh-pages package as a dev-dependency of the React app.
   "npm install gh-pages --save-dev"

2) Open the 'package.json' in your React application and add the "homepage" property.
    "http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}", 
    where username is your GitHub username, and {repo-name} is the name of the GitHub repository.

    So in my case:  "homepage": "http://LegoWalker.github.io/react-redux-todo-app"

3) Add the deploy script commands in your project’s 'package.json' file.
    In the 'package.json' file, add the "predeploy" property and the "deploy" property 
    with the existing "scripts" property. Your package.json scripts should like this:

    "scripts": { 
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
    },

    The predeploy script initiates after running our deploy script, which bundles our 
    application for deployment.

4) Now, deploy your application to "GitHub Pages". 
    For that, run the following commands in the integrated PowerShell/terminal in VS Code:
    
    "npm run deploy"

5) When you’ve successfully deployed the app, open the GitHub repository in your browser.
    Click the settings tab of the repository and scroll down until you reach the 
    GitHub Pages section and choose the "gh-pages branch" as the source.

Boom! your React application is hosted on GitHub Pages!
